           <h2><u>Our Purpose</u>:</h2>
        <p>Vision: An empowered Asian American community.</p>
<br>
<p>Mission: Developing leaders through innovative philanthropy.</p>
    <br><br>   
            <h2><u>Background</u>:</h2>
<p>Project by Project (PbP) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded in New York City in 1998 by a group of young Asian American professionals. Comprised of a team with backgrounds across finance, consulting, technology, media, entertainment and law, PbP’s founding team felt it could do more to empower the Asian American community. They established an organization with the mindset of volunteering, increasing awareness and fundraising for fellow organizations within the Asian American community.
<br><br>
Building upon those principles and looking to empower our community, PbP created an innovative platform by which our members exercise leadership skills through direct work and engagement with our partner non-profit organization.
<br>
Expanding from its New York roots, PbP welcomed its Los Angeles chapter in 2001, and San Francisco chapter in 2009.</p>
<br><br>
<h2><u>What We Do & How We Do It</u>:</h2>
<p>PbP selects a different theme to champion from year to year. Local chapters select a community-based non-profit organization that is focused on issues within that theme and tailors a year-long campaign to help its fundraising, community outreach and public awareness efforts.</p>
<br>
1. Fundraising:
<br>
<p>Our signature fundraising event is Plate by Plate, an annual tasting benefit featuring star chefs, top rated restaurants, and beverages from across the nation. 100% of the net proceeds from ticket sales raised from Plate by Plate are remitted to our partner organization.</p>
<br><br>
2. Community Outreach:
<p>PbP’s projects are designed in cooperation with our partner, usually in direct response to a community need, and range from discrete one-day activities to ongoing service commitments. Through this effort, members develop and hone in on their skills that they can then apply into other aspects of their professional and personal lives.</p>
<br><br>
3. Public Awareness:
<p>PbP believes that empowerment cannot occur without an increased level of consciousness. The organization therefore strives to educate and bring about awareness to issues that impact the Asian American community.</p>
<br>
4. Providing Human Capital:
<p>Each campaign incorporates multiple components to channel attention and new capital to our partners’ efforts. Our human capital is our key strength, and our Committees, combined with decades of time- tested infrastructure, create solutions that best meet the needs of the community.</p>
